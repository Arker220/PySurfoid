# PySurfoid
 PySurfoid - Pysurf, for Android!
 No releases available currently.
 # Why?
 Why not? I once tried making PySurfux, which was Pysurf for Linux, but I cancelled that project.
 # How?
 Because of how Pysurf is literally ONE .py file, I asked ChatGPT (i'm not kidding) to help me turn it to a .APK for Android. I used Android Studio to build it.
